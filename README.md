# ORAS MCP Server

## Usage

The ORAS MCP Server can be configured to be run using the [vscode agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode).

Since this MCP Server requires a local ORAS CLI, please make sure you have installed the [oras](https://github.com/oras-project/oras) (version >= `v1.3.0-beta.1`).

### Setup with Docker

It is easier to use docker to run the ORAS MCP Server.

#### Setup for VS Code

Add the following code to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "oras-mcp-server": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "docker",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--rm",
                "-i",
                "ghcr.io/shizhmsft/oras-mcp:main"
            ]
